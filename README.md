# Papyrus Sorting Project


# Introduction
 In the bustling city of Alexandria in the 1st century AD, the Great Library of Alexandria stood as a beacon of ancient knowledge. Among the scholars, Hero of Alexandria, a mathematician and engineer, faced the chaos of papyrus scrolls. This project aims to automate the organization of papyri using various sorting algorithms.

# Implemented Sorting Algorithms
* Selection Sort: Finds the minimum and places it at the beginning.
* Bubble Sort: Repeatedly exchanges adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
* Insertion Sort: Builds the final array one element at a time.
* Merge Sort: Divides the array and merges the sorted halves.
* Quick Sort: Selects a pivot and partitions the array around it.
* Heap Sort: Builds a heap and sorts the array using this heap.
* Comb Sort: Improves bubble sort by eliminating "turtles".
# Performance Analysis
The performance of the sorting algorithms was evaluated by measuring the execution time on a randomly generated list of real numbers. Here are the key observations:

Merge Sort and Quick Sort showed the best performance due to their recursive nature and ability to divide the problem into smaller sub-problems.
Bubble Sort and Selection Sort were the least performant, which was expected due to their algorithmic complexity in the worst cases.
# Conclusion
Merge Sort and Quick Sort proved to be the most efficient for organizing papyri. These algorithms are particularly suited for handling large collections, reflecting the need for efficient sorting methods in contexts similar to the Great Library of Alexandria.

# Visualization and Graphical Interface (Optional)
A graphical interface was developed to visualize the sorting process in real-time, offering an interactive perspective on how different algorithms organize data.

# Multithreading Use (Optional)
Multithreading was explored to execute different sorting algorithms in parallel, demonstrating the impact of using system resources on sorting performance.
